Hi, I'm Suraj. I'm a Grad student at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg. I'm specializing in software engineering along with some flavours of Data Analytics. I'm interested
in Python primarily and have recently started toying around with JavaScript for interactive visualizations with D3. I'm open to collaborate on anything. Reach me at
surajdmane007@gmail.com if interested.
